TODO: Enable Particle to be re-used for multiple experiments
TODO: Package prediction and correction for single line usage
TODO: Display results for multi-channel and multi-motion model


Update: Package prediction and correction ==> Done;
        Display results for multi-channel and multo-motion ==> Done
        Enable Particle tobe re-used for multiple experiments ===> Done

#TODO: Add covariance matrix for cross-channel velocity and acceleration

#TODO: Using cross-channel acceleration information for propagation and prediction
#TODO: Compare with using single channel information only

Conclusion:
    1. Using cross-channel acceleration information gain stable results for sharp changing area;
    2. For not-quite-curving segments, cross-channel and original line are quite similar
