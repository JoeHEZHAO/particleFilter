Problem: 
    1. After adjusting observationFCN, PF finally can work;
    2. The problem resides in particle propagation is not exactly matches real data changing trend;
    3. Solution is mapping particle propagation to observation space for calculating the weights;
    4. Reason is keeping particle ranges from [0, positive int], which corresponds to real data distribution;
    5. Next question is how to make [positive int] closer to 1 ?
